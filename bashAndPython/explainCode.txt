random-exit.py generates a random integer between 0 and 3 (inclusive),
 prints the value with a message, and then exits with the generated value as the exit code.
This Bash script takes a command as an argument and attempts to execute it repeatedly in a loop.
 The loop is designed to retry the command until either the command succeeds or a maximum of 5 attempts.
the Bash script attempts to run the provided command multiple times,
 waiting an increasing amount of time between retries, up to a maximum of 5 attempts.
 The script keeps retrying until the command succeeds or the maximum retry limit is reached.
